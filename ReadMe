We were unable to create the makefiles because we were not able to link sfml properly in those makefiles.

To run test cases, they must be all run individually. (comment out the other mains from the test cases, as well as the main function)
We know this is not a great solution but this is the only way we could get it to work.
We did not know that creating makefiles with SFML would be such a large issue.
We have already contacted professor Katchabaw about this issue.
